Why i ussed Dropwizzard
---

I choosed [Dropwizard](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard) because it simplified the building of the API using Jersey that was my first choice for REST and camed with an ops-friendly library called metrics, developed by them. Also i wanted to tested because i read a lot of recommendations for it and i just did 3 years of spring APIâ€™s so i wanted something different and promising. 
The process wasn't painless but the downsides that i expirienced aren't that bad.

I have more reasons but i wanted to keep this brief.
